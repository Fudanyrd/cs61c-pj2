# What this is
My implementation of Project 2 of CS61C(version su 20).

# What I leart from doing this Proj
I really should have followed the RISC-V calling convention, but as I was a lazy
guy, I didn't. As a result, I spent the whole day find the bugs caused by it! 
This indeed taught me a good lesson.
